        <img src="images/yoga.png" alt="Woman doing yoga" class="class-img">
        <p>
          Yoga is a total mind-body workout that not only burns calories and
          tones your muscles, it also combines stretching poses with breathing
          techniques and meditation. You will come out of our yoga classes
          having your body and mind strengthened and stretched!
        </p>

        <p class="class-length">Length: 55 minutes</p>

        <p class="note">
          We have extra, clean mats that we can loan out, but these are
          available on a first-come-first-served basis.

        <h2>Pilates</h2>
        <img src="images/pilates.jpg" alt="Woman doing pilates" class="class-img">
        <p>
          Pilates targets the core with slow, precise movements, and breath
          control and is low-impact. It also has a strong mind/body
          connection, so if you like yoga, but want a more intense core workout
          then Pilates is for you!
        </p>
